**Output is the number of steps and then the method, 
followed by the divisions in the x direction (nx) and 
finally the runtime for one nstep of the algorithm**

The program implements direct solvers for the 3D heat
equation.  FTCS and Crank Nicolson are implemented 
with the potential to use either constant or periodic
boundary conditions (selected in the driver).

The bonus ADI method is also implemented but only for
constant boundary conditions.

The time independent source term can be set in the 
initialize subroutine. Initially all elements are
set to zero and then select elements are made non-zero.

FTCS uses no subroutines.

Crank Nicholson uses subroutine ge_sub for Gaussian
Elimination. A is not represented sparsely but the 
ge_sub algorithm checks to see if the current scale
factor will be zero and if so does not perform the 
unnecessary operations (cuts the time by about 1/3)

ADI uses the tri_solve subroutine to solve the tri-
diagonal matricies in each direction. A is represented
sparsely (an element for each diagonal value).
