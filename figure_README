README for analysis figure, HW2
Stephanie Aho

The figure is runtime in seconds vs the size of the problem.
For instance, if size=100, then nx=ny=nz=100.  The boundary
conditions were set to zero.  

After nx=ny=nz=600, the program seems to hang, so no runtimes
for problem sizes greater than 600 were recorded.
